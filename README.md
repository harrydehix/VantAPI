# VantAPI
VantAPI, in short, is a NodeJS Rest API that, with the help of the [vproweather driver](https://github.com/bytesnz/vproweather), allows you to read and record weather data from any Vantage Pro console and publish it to the web via a secure interface.
Depending on your setup, there are several ways you can use the API.

## Setup Types

#### Local Linux Device Connected To Vantage Console Pushes Data To Public API Server
